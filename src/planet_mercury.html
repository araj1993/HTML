    <h1>Mercury: A Quick Overview</h1>
    <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun in our solar system. It is the smallest planet, slightly larger than Earth’s Moon. Mercury orbits the Sun once every 88 Earth days, making it the fastest planet. A single day on Mercury lasts about 59 Earth days due to its slow rotation.</p>
    <p>The planet’s surface is rocky and heavily cratered, resembling our Moon. Temperatures on Mercury vary widely, reaching up to 427°C (800°F) during the day and dropping to -173°C (-280°F) at night. Mercury has a very thin atmosphere that cannot retain heat.</p>
    <p>NASA’s MESSENGER mission provided detailed images and scientific data about Mercury from 2011 to 2015. The planet is named after the Roman messenger god, known for speed. Despite its small size, Mercury has a weak magnetic field similar to Earth’s.</p>
